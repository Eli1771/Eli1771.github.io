Before Flatiron, I was determined to use only free resources to teach myself web development. I've tried Codecademy, Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning and even Flatiron bootcamp-prep. No matter which syntax I focused on or how the program was laid out, as soon as I started learning OO, it was time to move on to the next language. 

How wrong I was. 

It's easy to believe that if you can do something one way, you're done learning about it. I'm not the first to be fooled into forgetting that it's better to work smarter than harder, but boy did I waste a lot of time and energy avoiding learning OO. I think the best thing about object orientation is that *rather than bending over backwards to try to think like the console, you're giving the console the tools it needs to think like a human.* 

I've only taken the first of the many steps towards becoming a bonafide developer. I've learned over and over that a good coder must embrace their mistakes and not be afraid to roll with the punches. I'll never stop learning lessons in this line of work (so maybe this will change in the future), but the best advice that I can give to an aspiring developer right now is *embrace object orientation and semantics.* 

I would love to expand on this in future blog posts with specific examples, but for now I'll just say this: It is always be easier to think in terms of *things* than in terms of names, so don't try to force it like I did for years!
