I never expected to like coding. I've always been a problem solver, an info sponge and an avid lover of puzzles (in retrospect this field actually seems pretty obvious), but programming seemed to dry and full of memorization. I thought of it as something akin to learning a foreign language, which - despite my interests in linguistics itself - I have never found very fun. 

I tried a few lessons on Codecademy per a friends suggestion and was almost immediately hooked. The beauty of developement for my is in the way that programs seem to take a life of their own, even very close to the beginning of a project. It feels like fast-forward gardening. You start with a simple idea, and as you impliment functionality you're presented with new mini challenges. Some of these turn into still more challenges further alond, but many others inspire ideas for added capabilities in your program. These turn into more problems/ideas and so on and so forth. I'm always amazed that I can't anticipate what aspects of my code will trip me up, or what improvements I might impliment when I'm just starting out. Coding is a beautiful process of pruning and cultivating that never gets old for me. 

I have to stop myslef here because I've just realize that this is a coding blog for other coders, so of course I don't have to explain why this is so much fun. That being said, when you're deep in a challenging lab it's nice to step back and appreciate why you got into this field in the first place. 

Happy coding!
