*Dos and donts? Do-s and dont-s? Hmmm...*


My life as a coder can be summed up into two volumes: the last four months or so of Flatiron school - a very regimented, ambitious, Ruby-based curriculum - and the four or so years before that - casual, inconsistent, self-taught JS based developement. Obviously, these two sections of my programming life have been very different from eachother, but I've been surprised and charmed by the number of common threads between the two. 

I've found that no matter what stage or form of education you find yourself in (and I think you're always being educated, it's just a matter of whether or not it's on purpose), you tend to find yourself in a bit of a tightrope walk. I'm a big believer in speed-coding wherever possibe, but obviously there's such a thing as *too* fast.

I'd like to talk about pacing now, but in order to get away from my usual rambling, ambling, loosely narrative blog style, I've decided to create a short list of neat, quantifyable guidelines that have been working for me. These are some ways that have helped me to better discern when to keep drilling down on a certain aspect of a project or lesson, and when it's time to leave well enough alone. 


* Stick between 30 and 60 minutes per codding session with short breaks in between.

* Never *just* code! Some music, a show I've seen a ton of times, or even a snack helps keep my passive perception occupied so I can focus on what I'm doing.

* The moment when you fix an error that was caused by a tiny typo somwhere completely different from where you were looking is a great opportunity to take a break from the computer.

* Your code works, but it's rough around the edges and you haven't done any abstracting. Not a good time to switch projects *or* tasks within your current project.

* Your code works and you've done a quick once-over to neaten things up and abstract redundant code. Not a good time to switch projects, but definitely move to a different aspect of your current app.

* Your entire app works as expected, you've neatened up everything along the way, and you've gone in one last time to do another round of abstraction. You still have things you'd like to tweak and features you'd like to add. Move on! This is the sweet spot for me to switch to a new project. I feel good about the work I've done, I don't feel like I'm "turning in" a sloppy final product, but there are other things I could be learning or starting, so go learn and go start! You can always come back and keep tweaking.

* 'This is impossible, there's no way I'm fixing this', is not a good reason to stop coding and go do something else, but it *is* a nice time to switch over to a different task within your project to get out of your head a bit.


This school has been great, and on one hand I'm raring to get into the field and start applying for some jobs! That being said, I need to be writing code I can be proud of along the way, and there could be no worse time to start building bad habits than right now. These guidelines work for me and my personal style as a way of keeping my priorities straight and keeping my speed in the sweet spot. Maybe they can work for you too! 

Happy Coding!!
